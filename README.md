# Stashing

Git provides an easy way of stashing these uncommitted changes so that we can return to them later, without having to make unnecessary commits.

## Git Stash

`git stash` is super useful command that helps you save changes that you are not yet ready to commit. You can stash changes and then come back to them later.

Running `git stash` will take all uncommitted changes (staged and unstaged) and stash them, reverting the changes in your working copy.

> You can also use git stash save instead
