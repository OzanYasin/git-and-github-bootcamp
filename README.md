# Git Tags

Tags are pointers that refer to particular points in Git history. We can mark a particular moment in time with a tag. Tags are most often used to mark version releases in projects (v4.1.0, v4.1.1, etc.)

Think of tags as branch references that do NOT CHANGE. Once a tag is created, it always refers to the same commit. It's just a label for a commit.
