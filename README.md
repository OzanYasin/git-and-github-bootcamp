# Basics of Github

Github is a hosting platform for git repositories. You can put your own Git repos on Github and access them from anywhere and share them with people around the world.

Beyond hosting repos, Github also provides additional collaboration features that are not native to Git (but are super useful). Basically, Github helps people share and collaborate on repos.

## Difference between Git & Github

**Git** is the version control software that runs locally on your machine. You don't need to register for an account. You don't need the internet to use it. You can use Git without ever touching Github.

**Github** is a service that hosts Git repositories in the cloud and makes it easier to collaborate with other people. You do need to sign up for an account to use Github. It's an online place to share work that is done using Git.

## Collaboration

If you ever plan on working on a project with at least one other person, Github will make your life easier! Whether you're building a hobby project with your friend or you're collaborating with the entire world, Github is essential!

## Open Source Projects

Today Github is THE home of open source projects on the Internet. Projects ranging from React to Swift are hosted on Github.

If you plan on contributing to open source projects, you'll need to get comfortable working with Github.
