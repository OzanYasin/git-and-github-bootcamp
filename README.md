## Commits in Details

### **Atomic Commits**

When possible, a commit should encompass a single feature, change, or fix. In other words, try to keep each commit focused on a single thing.

This makes it much easier to undo or rollback changes later on. It also makes your code or project easier to review.

### **Present-Tense Imperative Style**

Describe your changes in imperative mood, e.g. "make xyzzy do frotz" instead of "[This patch] makes xyzzy do frotz" or "I changed xyzzy to do frotz", as if you are giving orders to the codebase to change its behavior.

**You do NOT have to follow this pattern**

Though the Git docs suggest using present-tense imperative messages, many developers prefer to use past-tense messages. All that matters is consistency, especially when working on a team with many people making commits
